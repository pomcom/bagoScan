# bagoScan

`bagoscan` is a prototype tool to run multiple security scans in parallel on a given target.
It currently supports `testssl` `nmap` `ffuf` `nuclei` `sqlmap` and other scans, and can easily be extended 
to include other tool.
It is written in Go as part of a bachelor's degree project at HTW Berlin.

The prototype was developed to test to what extent steps of a manual penetration test can be automated in a short time.
